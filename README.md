# Cake-it
This is a quality assurance plan for "Cake it" application
“Cake it” is a cake baking mobile application that enables any cake specializing bakery's counter staff, 
cake decorators, to take user's order and bake for them a perfect cake and deliver it to their house in minutes. 
This application provides all type of cakes like birthday cakes, anniversary cakes, wedding cakes and many more. 
It is easy for the user to choose and find the most suitable cake for them. The user can either choose from available cake that provided 
by different bakeries or they can design a new cake for them self’s, “cake it” allows the user to choose the size of the cake, color of the cake, 
and flavor of the cake etc. In this project we will produce a detailed quality plan and different quality aspects related to this application. 
The quality plan will include project scope, constraints, functional requirements, integration requirements, and the quality goals.
